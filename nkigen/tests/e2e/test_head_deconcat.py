"""
End-to-end tests for head de-concatenation (reshape + transpose + reshape).

This is the pattern used in multi-head attention to merge head outputs back
into the hidden dimension:
    (BH, seq, hdim) -> (B, N, seq, hdim) -> (B, seq, N, hdim) -> (BS, hidden)

The 4D transpose [0,2,1,3] creates a 4D SBUF alloc where dim 0 = batch (small),
not the partition dim (128).  Without the SharedHbm workaround, legalize-layout
cannot tile this alloc and getBaseAndOffsets maps d0 to the batch dim, causing
OOB access in BIR simulation.

The workaround annotates the 4D transpose output as SharedHbm so the transpose
stays in HBM and the SBUF alloc is never created.

    """
    Minimal reproducer for the head-deconcat SBUF dim 0 bug.

    Without the SharedHbm knob on the transpose output, the compiler creates
    memref<2x128x2x128xf32, sbuf> with dim 0 = batch = 2.  NISA lowering
    assumes dim 0 = partition (128), causing OOB.

    The SharedHbm workaround keeps the transpose in HBM, sidestepping the issue.
